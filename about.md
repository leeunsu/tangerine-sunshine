I am a visual designer currently living in La Jolla, CA. Though my career in design roots predominately from illustrative art, I quickly found and affinity for product design and coding during my two years as a literature & writing major at UC San Diego (I know. Writing. Wild). My first job was here, as a student designer at [Associated Students Graphic Studio](https://asgraphicstudio.ucsd.edu), where I had the opportunity to design for huge student events like Triton Fest and Sun God Festival. I was also the creative co-director of Other People, a student-run literary magazine on campus.

I am currently a Visual Designer at Kiva, working with a team of amazing designers to help create a product that gives the underserved a chance to grow as individuals,  as businesses, and as communities.

In my free time I like to write, play games, and listen to music. I am also a dog person and a tea lover. 🐶🍵
