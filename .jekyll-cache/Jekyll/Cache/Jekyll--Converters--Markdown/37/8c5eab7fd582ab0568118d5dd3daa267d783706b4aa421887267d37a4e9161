  <li>Make a site that is responsive so that students will be able to utilize it regardless of where they are viewing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>For this project, I was inspired by similar sites that focused on marketing their individual events. My mood boards stretched from festival websites to facebook and yelp event listings.</p>

<p>I wanted to make the entirety of the Triton Fest website as informationally minimalistic as possible — just like the cards I used for my mood board — displaying only event, time, date, and location. In doing so would make the site a brief, yet informative and enjoyable experience.</p>
