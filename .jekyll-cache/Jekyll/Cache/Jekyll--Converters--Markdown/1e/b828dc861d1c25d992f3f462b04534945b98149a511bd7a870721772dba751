<p>The objective of this project was to design and develop a website for Winter Triton Fest 2020. Winter Triton Fest is an annual late night, weekend event series held at the beginning of winter quarters at UC San Diego. They host a number of events, including talks from Josh Peck, Stephanie Soo, Anne Phung, and more.</p>

<p>I wore many hats in this project as a lot of the staff was out for winter break üò≠. However, it challenged me to build a project independently. For this project, I built the <strong>UX/UI, the brand design, and social media assets</strong>.</p>

<p>When first thinking of building the site, I took into consideration why students would visit it in the first place ‚Äî what would necessitate the site? Looking at prior Triton Fest sites, I saw that it consisted of a list of events, each linking to a separate facebook event page. Though the site was functional, it wasn‚Äôt so much practical as it took the viewer out of the site and into Facebook.<br /><br />I also considered that many of these students would be looking at these events not only on their laptops, but on their phone.</p>

<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>

<p>I wanted to create a site that would allow students to explore and share all the events offered at Triton Fest without having to leave the site itself. To do this, I kept three things in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an experience that makes it easy for students to delve into all the events.</li>
  <li>Make ‚Äúlocation‚Äù and ‚Äúdate‚Äù easily ‚Äúscreen-shotable‚Äù so that students can share.</li>
  <li>Make a site that is responsive so that students will be able to utilize it regardless of how they are viewing it.</li>
</ul>
