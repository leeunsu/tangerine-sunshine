I"‡<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>The objective of this project was to create a website for Other People Literary Magazine. As the creative co-director, I also had the task of leading a team of designers and developers to build it. In having a team of students that would eventually graduate and go off start adulting, we needed to be mindful of making a site that could easily be passed onto others.</p>

<h2 id="role">Role</h2>

<p>As the creative co-director, I oversaw and developed the <strong>UX/UI design</strong>, <strong>frontend development</strong>, as well as designed the overall <strong>brand/identity</strong> of Other People.</p>

<h2 id="brainstorming">Brainstorming</h2>

<p>When first brainstorming this project, we wanted to <strong>create an experience focused on readership/viewership</strong>. We also wanted to <strong>create a modular design system</strong>; In doing so would pave way for succeeding developers to carry on the work fluidly. The third objective was to <strong>create a site on a content management system</strong> so that the editorial team can easily update the front matter.</p>

<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>

<p>Our proposal was to, first, create a <strong>minimalist/brutalist design</strong> for the site that would place focus on the contributions (literature and art). It allows for minimal distractions and focuses on readership and viewership.</p>

<p>Our second proposal was to use a coding language that could not only be modular, but easily learned/recognized. For this, we decided to use a <strong>Jekyll/Sass</strong> combo.</p>

<p>Our third proposal was to use a headless content management system, so that â€” in the case of a system falling off trend â€” the designers could easily chop the head off and replace it. For this, we decided to use <strong>Forestry.io</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a minimalist/brutalist design for max readability.</li>
  <li>Make an easy/modular coding design system</li>
  <li>Use a headless CMS</li>
</ul>
