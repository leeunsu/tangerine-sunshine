## Objective

One objective of this design was to **create a modular design system**. In doing so would pave way for succeeding developers to carry on the work fluidly. Another objective of this design was to **create an experience focused on readership**.

The idea of the minimal/brutalist design was to create a space that would spotlight attention to the contributions (the literature and art). It allows for minimal distractions and focuses on readership and viewership. As a perk, at the bottom right of the screen is a fixed toggle for light and dark mode.

* Make "location" and "date" easily "screen-shotable" so that students can share.
* Make a site that is responsive so that students will be able to utilize it regardless of where they are viewing it.

## Process

### Research

For this project, I was inspired by similar sites that focused on marketing their individual events. My mood boards stretched from festival websites to facebook and yelp event listings.

I wanted to make the entirety of the Triton Fest website as informationally minimalistic as possible — just like the cards I used for my mood board — displaying only event, time, date, and location. In doing so would make the site a brief, yet informative and enjoyable experience.
