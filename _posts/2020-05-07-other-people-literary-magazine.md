## Objective

The objective of this project was to create a website for Other People Literary Magazine. As the creative co-director, I also had the task of leading a team of designers and developers to build it. In having a team of students that would eventually graduate and go off start adulting, we needed to be mindful of making a site that could easily be passed onto others.

## Role

As the creative co-director, I oversaw and developed the **UX/UI design**, **frontend development**, as well as designed the overall **brand/identity** of Other People.

## Brainstorming

When first brainstorming this project, we wanted to **create an experience focused on readership/viewership**. We also wanted to **create a modular design system**; In doing so would pave way for succeeding developers to carry on the work fluidly. The third objective was to **create a site on a content management system** so that the editorial team can easily update the front matter.

And, of course, it had to be responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Proposal

Our proposal was to, first, create a **minimalist/brutalist design** for the site that would place focus on the contributions (literature and art). It allowed for minimal distractions and focuses on readership and viewership.

Our second proposal was to use a coding language that could not only be modular, but easily learned/recognized. For this, we decided to use a **Jekyll/Sass** combo.

Our third proposal was to use a headless content management system, so that — in the case of a system falling off trend — the designers could easily chop the head off and replace it. For this, we decided to use **Forestry.io**.

* Use a minimalist/brutalist design for max readability.
* Make an easy/modular coding design system
* Use a headless CMS

## Process

### Research

One of the things that drew us into creating a brutalist design for Other People was the capacity to make an easy design system. Further, having these modules/components enabled the designers and developers to work more closely together as it acted like a sort of buffer between the two. We utilized Figma to translate design into development.

Another thing that drew us to a brutalist design was that stray away from a corporate look to a more liberal and human design.

We also used Jekyll to build modules through "includes", making each component of the site easily modified/replaceable.
