## Objective

The objective of this project was to design and develop a website for Winter Triton Fest 2020. Winter Triton Fest is an annual late night, weekend event series held at the beginning of winter quarters at UC San Diego. They host a number of events, including talks from Josh Peck, Stephanie Soo, Anne Phung, and more.

## Role

I wore many hats in this project as a lot of staff were out for winter break ðŸ˜­. However, it really challenged me to build alone (with the benefit of total creative freedom). For this project, I built the UX/UI, the brand design, and the social media assets.

## Brainstorming

When first thinking of building the site, I took into consideration why students would visit it in the first place â€” what would necessitate the site? Looking at prior Triton Fest sites, I saw that it consisted of a list of events, each linking to a separate facebook event page. Though the site was functional, it wasn't so much practical as it took the viewer out of the site and into facebook. <br><br> I also considered that many of these students would be looking at these events not only on their laptops, but on their phone.

## Proposal

I wanted to create a site that would allow students to explore and share all the events offered at Triton Fest without having to leave the site. To do this, I kept three things in mind:

* Create an experience that makes it easy for students to explore all the events without having to leave the site.
* Make "location" and "date" easily "screen-shotable" so that students can share the event.
* Make a site that is responsive so that students will be able to utilize it wherever they are.
